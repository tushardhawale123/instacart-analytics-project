# Technical Implementation

## Architecture Overview

This project implements a modern data pipeline with the following components:

```
[Raw Data Sources] → [Data Preparation (Python/Pandas)] → [SQL Server Database]
       ↓
[Azure Data Lake Storage] ← [Azure Data Factory Pipelines] → [Azure Databricks]
       ↓                                                          ↓
[Power BI Dashboards] ← ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ┘
```

## Technologies Used

### Data Processing & Storage
- **Python (PyCharm)**: Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis
- **SQL Server (SSMS)**: Relational data storage and querying
- **PySpark (Docker)**: Large-scale data processing
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**: Cloud data storage
- **Azure Data Factory**: Data orchestration and movement

### Advanced Analytics
- **Azure Databricks**: Advanced analytics and machine learning
- **PySpark ML**: Predictive modeling

### Visualization
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and reports

## Implementation Details

### Data Ingestion & Preparation
1. Data cleaned and validated using Python/Pandas
2. Data loaded into SQL Server for relational storage
3. Data processed at scale using PySpark in Docker container
4. Processed data uploaded to Azure Data Lake Storage

### Cloud Processing
1. Azure Data Factory pipelines orchestrate data movement
2. Azure Databricks notebooks perform advanced analytics:
   - User segmentation using K-means clustering
   - Product association analysis
   - Time-based purchase pattern analysis
   - Machine learning models for reorder prediction

### Visualization
1. Power BI connects to Azure SQL Database
2. Star schema data model created with proper relationships
3. DAX measures developed for business metrics
4. Interactive dashboards designed for different analysis perspectives

## Performance Considerations

1. **Indexing Strategy**: 
   - Clustered indexes on primary keys
   - Non-clustered indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Filtered indexes for specific query patterns

2. **Query Optimization**:
   - Partitioning of large tables by order_date ranges
   - Appropriate join strategies
   - Query hint usage where necessary

3. **PySpark Optimizations**:
   - Caching of frequently accessed DataFrames
   - Broadcast joins for small dimension tables
   - Repartitioning for shuffle optimization

4. **Azure Databricks**:
   - Delta Lake format for ACID transactions
   - Appropriate cluster sizing based on data volume
   - Notebook job scheduling for periodic refresh
